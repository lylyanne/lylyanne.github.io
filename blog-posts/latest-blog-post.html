	  	 <h4 class="date">30 August 2014</h4>
       	 <p>The H-1B debate is an issue that is rather personal for me.</p>
         <h3>A little background</h3>
		<p>H-1B is a non-immigrant visa in the U.S. that allows companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations. Those specialty occupation are usually in fields such as STEM, medicine, and architecture with the tech industry being one of its biggest user.</p>
		<p>H-1B visa has to be sponsored by an employer. A foreign worker can never sponsor their own visa no matter how skilled or well-financed they are.</p>
		<p>To be eligible for H-1B visa, one has to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li> have a Bachelor's degree or higher</li>
			<li> being sponsored for a job that actually requires that degree (i.e. Google can't sponsor an awesome web developer who happens to have an M.D. and B.A. in English. )</li>
			<li> being paid a prevailing wage</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Every year 85,000 new H-1B is available to be made with 65,000 available to those with Bachelor's degree and 20,000 available to those with Master's degree.</p>
		<p>Once H-1B is issued, it is good up to 6 years during which employer can sponsor green card for the employee to stay permanently in the US. In the case where employer do not sponsor green card for the employee, the employee can work abroad for 1 year before being eligible for another 6 years worth of H-1B.</p>
		<h3>Sounds like a great program... what's the problem?</h3>
		<p>Every year proponents of the H-1B (a.k.a. tech companies) lobby to have the 85,000 number increased citing inability to find top talent locally and this issue preventing them to compete globally.</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, American workers claim that H-1B visa program is costing them those highly skilled highly paid jobs as foreign workers are more willing to accept less pay and forego holidays and weekends to work to maintain their legal status in the U.S.A.</p>
		<h3>My take on it</h3>
		<p>I think the H-1B visa is a great program and allow the U.S. to grab top talents from around the world. However, it is open for all kinds of abuse. You can read about a sample case <a href="http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-07-20/news/29794893_1_h-1b-visa-h-1b-workers-indian-workers">here</a></p>
		<p>My suggestion to improve H-1B:</p> 
		<p>- Add a provision to try to hire U.S. worker's first. This provision is actually available for employer based green card sponsorship but not for H-1B. As you can see from above, to get an H-1B, a foreign worker just have to find a job related to their degree and have the company willing to sponsor them.</p>
		<p>- Create a strict rule to validate the provision above. Hypothetical scenario: is it enough for a company to meet the above provision by putting a small ad in local newspaper and then claimed no qualified American worker applied?</p>
		<p>- Better guidelines of prevailing wages. If we at the very least have something like, foreign workers in the Pacific states need to make at least x dollars while foreign workers in the Midwest need to make at least y dollars, it will reduce the wage abuse. Companies will hire the better skilled individual if the x and y is close or slightly over the average American salary for the job.</p>
		<p><em>Disclaimer: I was an H-1B holder for awhile before I became naturalized. This article comes about from my personal experience and years following this issue.</em></p>
