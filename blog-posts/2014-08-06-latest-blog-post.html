	  	 <p>Buzzfeed</p>
         <p>Buzzfeed is a news and entertainment site. It is one of my favorite site because of the content as oppose to its UI design.</p>
         <p>When I visit buzzfeed, the first thing I notice is the slide at the top of the page. It lists all the things the editor think I should check out. The things they recommended are pretty much in line with the latest pop culture so it is a one site fix for me to keep up with the latest entertainment news.</p>
		 <p>5 adjectives I would use to describe the website is: well-branded, cluttered, modern, colorful, and consistent. What really pop-up is how cluttered the website is. There are so many eye-catching pictures and titles that I want to check out at the same time. As I am surfing the site, I keep having to go back to the main page because I don't know an easy way to find the other articles I want to read.</p> 
		 <p>5 adjectives I would use to describe the content is: hilarious, informative, entertaining, animated and light-hearted. I can go to the site after a long day and check out breaking news from the world as well as entertain myself with funny articles and fun quizzes.</p>
		 <p>Buzzfeed doesn't sell anything and it doesn't look like they have ads either. I'm not sure how they are making their money. There are a few sponsored posts though, maybe they get a percentage when I click through them, but from experience those sponsored posts are not as entertaining as the ones written by the staff.</p> 
		 <p>I find visiting Buzzfeed relaxes me and put me in better mood. But I also think I waste a lot of time when I'm on it. The plan is always "I'll be on it for 5 minutes" and then an hour-and-a-half would pass by and I'm still reading!</p>
