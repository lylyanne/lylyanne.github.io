	  	 <h4 class="date">10 August 2014</h4>
         <p>I am excited to be joining Dev Bootcamp (DBC). DBC seems to be a tight knitted learning community where everyone is in this journey together, pushing each other to be their best.</p>       		  
		 <p>DBC is very big on pairing and I agree that communication is one of the essential skill for any job, coding included. Pairing will give me a chance to improve my communication and empathy skills. DBC is also big on giving and receiving feedback and as an introvert, it will take a little getting used to for me to be communicating that much on a daily basis.</p>
		 <p>Regarding the onsite learning, I expect it to be intense. That I will have days where I am impressed how much I am comprehending as well as days where I wonder if signing up is a mistake. I have read enough DBC blogs to know that those feelings are pretty common. Those students were able to get through the program and I am confident I can too.</p>
		 <p>DBC graduates a cohort every 3 weeks and I have a bit of reservation about that. The program has been around since 2012 and while I heard great things about it, there will be a whole lot of students competing for the same Jr Web Developer jobs.</p>
		 <p>I am a bit worried about the job prospect post DBC. I believe I will learn a lot in the program but I signed up hoping for a career change and not just getting immerse in my hobby. Not to mention, after DBC, quite a bit of other coding bootcamps have been popping up all over Bay Area. Will there be enough jobs for all of us and more importantly, will there be a degradation of the quality of engineers produced by DBC and these other bootcamps and as a result, putting off employers from these programs? I don't know the answer to these questions and I decided to take a chance on DBC.</p>
