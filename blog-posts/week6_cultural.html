	  	 <h4 class="date">14 September 2014</h4>
       	 <p>Stereotype threat is a negative stereotype based on one's race, gender, or sexual preference. A couple examples of stereotype threats are: <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/bibliography_yeung_vonhippel.html">women must be bad drivers</a>, <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/bibliography_gonzales_blanton_williams.html">
latin american students must be bad in school</a>, and <a href="ttp://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/bibliography_bosson_haymovitz_pinel.html">homosexual men must be bad at childcare</a>.
<p>According to research paper by <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html">Steele and Aronson</a>, stereotype threat negatively affect academic performance of any individual for whom the situation invokes a stereotype-based expectation of poor performance. This in turn caused the individual to not attempt certain career (usually high paying) and not trying hard enough on certain tasks. Over time, avoiding certain career path caused social inequality for certain group of people.</p>
<p>During the research, Steele and Aronson conducted an experiment where a group of black and white students were given a test. The test were designed to be difficult for both the black and white students. When told that the test is performed to measure intellectual abilities, the black students performed significantly worse than the white students. However, when told that the test is simply a fun problem solving exercise, the black students performed on par with the white students.</p>
<p>Personally, I feel that stereotype threat has affected me as well. I studied Computer Science in college but never pursued the programming jobs after graduation. Instead I pursued the lesser technical IT Business Analyst position believing that while I am good at math and science and have analytical ability, I might not be able to keep up if "things get too technical". I conform to the gender stereotype that women aren't technical.</p>
<p>I found that the experiment result from Steele and Aronson is very encouraging. It proved that those stereotypes are not true. We made it true by believing it and act accordingly. I need to remember this the next time I feel I couldn't do something because I am a girl or Asian.</p>
