	  	 <h4 class="date">24 August 2014</h4>
         <p>According to <a href=“http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm“>Gregorc Thinking Style</a>, I am a Concrete Sequential thinker.</p>
     	 <p>As a concrete sequential thinker, I gather information from facts that I can verify with my senses and I process the information in a linear manner.</p> 
     	 <p>I find it easy to:</p>
         <ul>
         	<li>follow direction that is given in a step by step manner</li>
			<li>follow routine</li>
			<li>work alone</li>
			<li>work with people where there is a clear breakdown of responsibilities (i.e. you write the code for feature A and the test for feature B. I write the test for feature A and the code for feature B).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I find it hard to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>work with ideas that I can't envision into something practical.</li>
			<li>work in unstructured environment with abstract goal.</li>
			<li>Incorporate emotion during group project.</li> 
		</ul>
		<p>Dev Bootcamp is pretty good about giving clear instruction and numbering the challenges so that I can do the reading and finish the task sequentially.</p>
		<p>However, Dev Bootcamp environment also favors peer-pairing and group projects and this is where I can get in trouble if I am not prepared. I am not very good at having to think-on-the-spot and most of the time that's what I need to do when working with people since we'll formulate solution based on the back and forth discussion.</p> 
		<p>My strategy for this is to not get behind with the challenge's learning competencies. The more I comprehend the learning competencies prior to meeting with my peer or group members, the easier it will be for me to translate the abstract ideas given by my peers into something more concrete in my mind or to provide additional ideas.</p>
		<p>Another strategy is to ask my peer or group members to solve things sequentially or to solve one thing at a time. For example in the responsive design challenge, we could've agree not to move on to other things before we are satisfied with navigation links appearing properly. So even though there were a lot of people throwing different ideas, it was all for a particular thing and it will be easier for me to follow the discussion.</p>
		<p>When working with others, I realized that I tend to focus too much on completing the task and I don't do enough of emotional check-in. Emotional check-in might not be part of my thinking style but it might be an integral part of others' thinking style. I plan to do more of this by: checking if my peer and I are still in the same page, if my peer agree with the code we have so far, if they have some reservation with current approach, if they have better ideas or things they would like to try out, or if they would like to make a general comment.</p>
