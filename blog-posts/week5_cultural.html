	  	 <h4 class="date">7 September 2014</h4>
       	 <p>By now I have pair program with several DBC students with some session goes smoother than others. I don't mind pair programming but I do prefer to work alone.</p>
       	 <h3>Pairing</h3>
         <p>For pair programming, I prefer the expert-novice pairing because this style requires both parties to try and solve the problem on their own before coming together. The party that has clear idea on solving the problem can get the other party unstuck. This pair programming style saves a lot of time and benefit both parties. The novice learns how this particular problem can be solved while the expert learns how to explain technical concept in a clear manner. Win-win!</p>
		 <p>Now I don't mind the regular driver-navigator pairing where both parties are trying to solve the problems together. When things are moving along, great! But when both parties are stuck and we reach "shooting dart in the dark" stage, I slowly become anxious. I feel that we are wasting time watching each other googling and reading stack overflow. It will be more productive if we separate, try to solve the problem, and reconvene when we have better idea.</p>
		<h3>Feedback</h3>
		<p>After each pairing session, we are expected to give each other feedback. The feedback should be kind, actionable, and specific. In the feedbacks I wrote, I try to be truthful and kind and I have been getting the same.</p> 
		<p>Reading the feedback others wrote for me does make me feel vulnerable. But I try to focus on the positive here. We are just getting to know each other and for many, this is the first time we work with each other. So instead of taking every criticism at face value, I try to find common pattern in my feedback. I will work on one criticism that different students keep writing about me and accept the positive compliment as my strength.</p>
