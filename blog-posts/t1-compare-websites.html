Comparing three websites

Buzzfeed

Buzzfeed is a news and entertainment site. It is one of my favorite site because of the content as oppose to its UI design.

When I visit buzzfeed, the first thing I notice is the slide at the top of the page. It lists all the things the editor think I should check out. The things they recommended are pretty much in line with the latest pop culture so it is a one site fix for me to keep up with the latest entertainment news.

5 adjectives I would use to describe the website is: well-branded, cluttered, modern, colorful, and consistent. What really pop-up is how cluttered the website is. There are so many eye-catching pictures and titles that I want to check out at the same time. As I am surfing the site, I keep having to go back to the main page because I don't know an easy way to find the other articles I want to read. 

5 adjectives I would use to describe the content is: hilarious, informative, entertaining, animated and light-hearted. I can go to the site after a long day and check out breaking news from the world as well as entertain myself with funny articles and fun quizzes.

Buzzfeed doesn't sell anything and it doesn't look like they have ads either. I'm not sure how they are making their money. There are a few sponsored posts though, maybe they get a percentage when I click through them, but from experience those sponsored posts are not as entertaining as the ones written by the staff. 

I find visiting Buzzfeed relaxes me and put me in better mood. But I also think I waste a lot of time when I'm on it. The plan is always "I'll be on it for 5 minutes" and then an hour-and-a-half would pass by and I'm still reading!
