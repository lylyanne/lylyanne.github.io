	  	 <h4 class="date">08 August 2014</h4>
	  	 <p><strong>Buzzfeed</strong></p>
         <p>Buzzfeed is a news and entertainment site. It is one of my favorite site because of the content as oppose to its UI design.</p>
         <p>When I visit buzzfeed, the first thing I notice is the slide at the top of the page. It lists all the things the editor think I should check out. The things they recommended are pretty much in line with the latest pop culture so it is a one site fix for me to keep up with the latest entertainment news.</p>
		 <p>5 adjectives I would use to describe the website is: well-branded, cluttered, modern, colorful, and consistent. What really pop-up is how cluttered the website is. There are so many eye-catching pictures and titles that I want to check out at the same time. As I am surfing the site, I keep having to go back to the main page because I don't know an easy way to find the other articles I want to read.</p> 
		 <p>5 adjectives I would use to describe the content is: hilarious, informative, entertaining, animated and light-hearted. I can go to the site after a long day and check out breaking news from the world as well as entertain myself with funny articles and fun quizzes.</p>
		 <p>Buzzfeed doesn't sell anything and it doesn't look like they have ads either. I'm not sure how they are making their money. There are a few sponsored posts though, maybe they get a percentage when I click through them, but from experience those sponsored posts are not as entertaining as the ones written by the staff.</p> 
		 <p>I find visiting Buzzfeed relaxes me and put me in better mood. But I also think I waste a lot of time when I'm on it. The plan is always "I'll be on it for 5 minutes" and then an hour-and-a-half would pass by and I'm still reading!</p>
		 <br>
		 <p><strong>Google Finance</strong></p>
		 <p>Google is a financial site where you can check the stock market, bond market, currency exchange rate, and the likes. The site is not trying to sell anything and is provided for informational purposes only.
		 <p>The design of the site is clean, basic, and structured. The main focus of the information is placed in the middle and "additional information" is placed on the right and left side of the page.</p>
		 <p>Unlike buzzfeed, Google Finance hardly use any pictures except for a few charts to display the stock market prices and stock market indices movement. I think this suits their purpose very well. Just like Buzzfeed won't be fun without the witty pictures, Google Finance will be annoying if they start putting lots of pictures. This is an informational site and they utilize the space on the screen to provide solid information as opposed to entertaining their user.</p>
		 <p>Content wise, I like how once I select a particular stock to look into further, the page is refreshed with just that company's information. This saves me time from clicking back and forth for a particular info. I also like how the content of the stock quotes is updated in real-time so I am always getting the latest news. The real-time aspect really add usability value of the site for me personally.</p>
		 <p>It's not all hunky-dory. I do have a few gripes about the site from the design and usability point of view. </p>
		 <p>First, the site is customizable but only somewhat customizable. I can move some sections up and down and I can delete stocks I'm no longer interested in from the Recent Quote section. But there are certain sections that I cannot move at all or remove completely. Let's say I'm not interested in the company's physical address, I cannot move the address section or be rid of it to create more real estate on the screen. Grr!</p>
		 <p>Secondly, it provides a lot of info about a particular company but it doesn't have a buzz section. For those who are not familiar, a buzz section is a section where other people can comment on a particular stock similar to tweets about a particular topic. I thought one of Google's focus is about community but I can't see what the community's think of this stock from this medium. I have to visit MSN money specifically for this.</p> 
		 <p>Overall, Google Finance is a very useful site for me. When I leave the site, I got most of the information I am looking for.</p> 
		 <br>
		 <p><strong>PayPal</strong></p>
		 <p>PayPal is a site where you can send and receive money from other people's personal accounts as well as from merchant's accounts.</p>
		 <p>The design of the site is beautiful, to-the-point, simple, and modern. I say modern because I see the same styles over and over in 2014. It's the style where you divvy up the page into a couple sections and within a section you write a very simple text explaining one thing the site does. When the user scroll from top to bottom he will get a good gist of what the site is all about.</p>
		 <p>Regarding the content of the website, PayPal is a very convenient site to use. It helps bring e-commerce to an average joe. Gone are the days where you have to open a stand and accept cash only for your craft. You can now sell your skills and services and not worry about how to accept payment. It is a pioneer in the e-commerce field.</p>
		 <p>Personally I do not have a merchant account but PayPal organized the content of their site very well in the sense that I never see options that are not applicable to me. I use PayPal mostly to send money someone gave me to the bank or add more money so I can buy things without a credit card. I can perform this workflow with minimal clicks since invoicing and merchant options not applicable to me are not in my way.</p>
		 <p>Overall, I think PayPal is a very useful site for me personally. It makes my life easier. I always leave the site feeling I have accomplished the task at efficiently.</p>
