    <h3>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h3>
    <p>Pair programming is vital to DBC so students can practice communicating and utilize the strengths of their fellow programmers.</p>
    <p>Here are a few more reasons:</p>
    <ul class="fa-ul">
      <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-qq fa-fw"></i>catch errors early</li>
      <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-qq fa-fw"></i>learn from your pair's strength</li>
      <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-qq fa-fw"></i>practice empathy</li>

    <h3 class="questions">Compare Drive and Navigator</h3>
    <p>A <em>Driver</em> is the programmer who is writing the code under the direction of the navigator.
      However, the driver is free to give his opinion and ideas.</p>
    <p>A <em>Navigator</em> is programmer who is directing the driver in the implementation of the code.
      They work with the driver to cultivate ideas and then help the driver to write them.</p>

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>This was a fun and challenging pairing session for us. This was our first time working together so we are not familiar with each other's work habits, communication skills, and level of expertise. 
    <p>I, Felicia, feel like it was hard for me to voice my thoughts out loud and I had to resist the impulse of wanting to take over a few times. </p>
    <p>I, Ryan, had some difficulty towards the end of the session becasue we were attempting to impliment some styling that I was not familiar with so I had to take a back seat and I could not contribute as much as I would have liked.</p>
